## An Android app that connects consumers who want to donate food with NGOs.

**FinCept** is the NGO-facing Android application that is part of the Feed_In_Need project. This app allows NGOs to receive, manage, and coordinate food donation requests from consumers in real-time, helping bridge the gap between donors and those in need.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Manage Donation Requests**: View, accept, or decline donation requests from consumers.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Get instant updates on new donation requests and keep track of your pickups.
- **Firebase Integration**: Secure and reliable data management for seamless communication.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to manage NGO accounts.

## 📱 How It Works

1. **Sign Up / Login**: NGOs can create an account or log in with existing credentials.
2. **Receive Donation Requests**: Get notified whenever a consumer submits a food donation request.
3. **Accept or Decline**: Review the details and decide whether to accept the donation based on your availability and resources.
4. **Coordinate Pickup**: Once accepted, connect with the donor and arrange for pickup.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Android Studio**: The primary development environment.
